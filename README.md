# WPF Data Grid - Bind to PagedAsyncSource
This example demonstrates how to bind the [GridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.GridControl) to [PagedAsyncSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Data.PagedAsyncSource).

The solution in this example includes the following projects:

* **PagedAsyncSourceMVVMSample** - demonstrates the MVVM approach
* **PagedAsyncSourceSample** - demonstrates a basic non-MVVM approach

Refer to the [How to Use Virtual Sources](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/120194/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/bind-to-data/bind-to-any-data-source-with-virtual-sources/use-virtual-sources) tutorial to learn more.

## A 1-Click Solution for CRUD Web API Services with Role-based Access Control via EF Core & XPO

If you target .NET for your backend API, be sure to check out our free [Web API Service](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/403394/backend-web-api-service) and register your [FREE copy today](https://www.devexpress.com/security-api-free). The Solution Wizard scaffolds an OData v4 Web API Service (.NET 6+) with integrated authorization & CRUD operations powered by EF Core and our XPO ORM library. You can use OAuth2, JWT or custom authentication strategies alongside tools like Postman or Swagger (OpenAPI) for API testing. Among its numerous capabilities, our built-in Web API Service filters out secured server data based on permissions granted to users. Advanced/enterprise functions include audit trail, endpoints to download reports, file attachments, check validation, obtain localized captions, etc. To use the free Solution Wizard (which creates the Web API Service) run the Universal Component Installer from the [DevExpress Download Manager](https://www.devexpress.com/ClientCenter/DownloadManager/).

## More Examples

The following example shows how to bind the WPF Data Grid to different data sources: [Bind the WPF Data Grid to Data](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-bind-wpf-grid-to-data).

This example includes multiple solutions that demonstrate:
* How to bind the Data Grid to Entity Framework, EF Core, and XPO.
* Different binding mechanisms: virtual sources, server mode sources, and local data.
* MVVM and code-behind patterns.

After you bind the Data Grid to a database, you can implement CRUD operations (create, read update, delete). View the example: [Implement CRUD Operations in the WPF Data Grid](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-implement-crud-operations).
